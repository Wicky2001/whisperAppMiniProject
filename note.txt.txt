This is a mini version of wisper app .Using WICKSPER users can share there
secrets annomysly.


I used this post to demostrate my skills in frontend and backend.by doing this i get strong knowledge
of mongo db and nodejs. All so i use differnt kind of libraies such as passport, facebook goole authentication, express sessions etc
Also use mongo db for database management
